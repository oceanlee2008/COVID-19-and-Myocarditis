Decoding Acute Myocarditis in COVID-19 Patients: A Machine Learning Approach to Predictive Modelling through Blood Indices and Biomarker Analysis


Our investigation delivers an important understanding of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on blood indices and their correlation with COVID-19 severity and myocarditis. This study has the potential to guide clinical practice, providing physicians with a robust predictive model for myocarditis in COVID-19 patients, thereby enhancing early detection, improving treatment efficacy, and ameliorating patient outcomes.

We have identified an increased propensity for severe COVID-19 in older males, with myocarditis appearing more prevalent in younger demographics. Furthermore, we distinguished two separate disease profiles for COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic and severe, based on symptom severity and albumin/globulin ratio (AGR). Our study uncovers the utility of the Lymphocyte to Neutrophil Ratio (LNR) and Lymphocyte to Platelet Ratio (LPR) in predicting post-COVID-19 myocarditis. However, these should be used in conjunction with other clinical parameters and biomarkers due to their non- specificity. Most significantly, our multi-index predictive model yielded a substantial enhancement in predicting myocarditis risk (AUC = 0.924), promoting early identification of high-risk individuals and facilitating timely intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
